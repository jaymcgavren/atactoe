h1. ATacToe

A "real-time" Tic-Tac-Toe game, meaning both players move at the same time.  Block your opponent before they can complete a line, then go for the win yourself.  First to win 10 games wins the match!

h1. How to Run

Just grab the application for your platform (Windows or OS X), decompress, double-click, and play!  As long as you have Java installed, it should work out of the box.

h1. Controls

* Player 1
* * A/S/D/W - move cursor
* * Left-Shift - place mark
* Player 2
* * I/J/K/L - move cursor
* * Space - place mark
* Other
* Escape - exit

Or plug in a gamepad and use the D-pad and buttons.  XBox 360 controllers are officially supported for now, with more to come.
